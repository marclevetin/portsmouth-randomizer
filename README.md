# portsmouth-randomizer
For UNH-Portsmouth class

This site solves two problems:
* We wanted a fair way to call on folks during class, so the instructor didn't feel mean and students didn't feel picked on.  Just load the page and a new, random student's name will appear.

* We wanted a fair way to divide the class into groups.  Students often sit in the same seats, so they often grouped together.  We also wanted a fair way to set a group leader.
